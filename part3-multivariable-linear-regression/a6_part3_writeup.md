# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
My r squared value is 0.49314, this means the data is not entirly accurate.
2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
No, this is likley due to an error in the data.
3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?
The price for a 10 year old car with 89000 miles is $10,601. The  price for a 20 year old car with 150,000 miles is $2,802.
4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?
The majority of the data used is with younger cars with a smaller milage, so the model cannot properly predict a variety of cars.

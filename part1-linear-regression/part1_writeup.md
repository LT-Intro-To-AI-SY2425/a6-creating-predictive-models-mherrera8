# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
The r squared value is the varience in the dependent variable, this is how spread out the data is.
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
123.47
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
No, I think this model would need more data to base its predictions on, this way it would be more reliable. A variety of data may also be beneficial as there are many factors that can influence one's blood pressure.
